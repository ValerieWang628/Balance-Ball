# Bounce-a-ball Project in the Unity World -- by Yunzi (Valerie) Wang

This is a simple roll-a-ball project built in the Unity environment. 
It was first designed to reproduce the [Ballance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballance) game, to explore the 3D puzzle video game world and to teach myself basics of Unity and C#.

When setting up the level environment, I became intrigued to create a girlish and fantasy-like atmosphere with creamy color schemes. And I also had a good grasp of concepts like physical material, prefab, instantiation, rigid body, etc.
