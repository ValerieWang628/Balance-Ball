# Bounce-a-ball Project in the Unity World -- by Yunzi (Valerie) Wang

This is a simple roll-a-ball project built in the Unity environment. 
It was first designed to reproduce the [Ballance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballance) game, to explore the 3D puzzle video game world and to teach myself basics of [Unity](https://unity.com) and C#.

When setting up the level environment, I became intrigued to create a girlish and fantasy-like atmosphere with creamy color schemes. And I also had a good grasp of concepts like [physical material](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PhysicMaterial.html), [prefab](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html), [instantiate](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Instantiate.html), [rigid body](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html), etc.
